## Version 1.0
Still don't know how to name the version just a regular 1.0 
This is completely working Museum app where you can search the artifacts
and more, I have utilized the react-form-hook to do the searching in my 
search box, also mostly the designing is based on the Bootstrap-5 which is 
quite fascinating for me, straight up its just cancelling the work for css
still not sure its good thing or bad for my css learning journey, Let's see what else i used, 
oh yeah basic data fetching using swr. so far the good thing i have learned about the next js
is the concept of pre-rendering which basically is the main motive for optimizing the internet searching system.
So yeah still working and still learning 


##Version 1.1
All right this is seems to be the final version for this app right now this app is fully functional where a user can register and login to this website and can search museum artifacts and add them to their favorite list and they're also functionality for history I learned a lot from this assignment there were a ton of bugs and errors I have to face but at the end of the day it is finally complete this is my first completed web Project
